# Reddit-Scraper-Without-API
This Python script allows you to scrape data from the Reddit website using the JSON feed from a subreddit. It retrieves the latest "hot" posts from the /r/learnprogramming subreddit and extracts information such as the post title, author, upvotes, and URL. The extracted data is then saved into a CSV file for easy analysis and review.
